# Interview Practice Bot

This is a tool developed by terrablader11 designed to help individuals pursuing roles in actuarial science. The website allows for the generation of random interview questions from a bank of 400+ questions sourced from various areas, alongside selected answers. 

IMPORTANT: The tool has no functionality for high finance questions, or anything outside actuarial science for that matter.
